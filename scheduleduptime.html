      <h1>Hi there</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to scheduleduptime.com. We strive to achieve 100% downtime.
        Unfortunately, due to the realities of new users and occasional
        updated content, some amount of uptime is unavoidable.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, in these cases we are committed to providing our users with
        the information necessary to plan around these inages.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next scheduled uptime is available by performing a DNS query for
        TXT records on the scheduleduptime.com domain. This web page is
        available over HTTP at the times indicated. The VM running this site
        shuts down during all other times.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're interested in our content but not able to access it during
        scheduled uptime, Here is a node.js script that will determine the
        next uptime window and retrieve the HTML content at the appropriate
        time, saving it to scheduleduptime.html to be read at your leisure.
