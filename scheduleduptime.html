      <h1>This web page is usually not available</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to scheduleduptime.com. We strive to achieve 100% downtime.
        Unfortunately, due to the realities of new users and occasional
        updated content, some amount of uptime is unavoidable.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, in these cases we are committed to providing our users with
        the information necessary to plan around these inages.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next scheduled uptime is available by performing a DNS query for
        TXT records on the next.scheduleduptime.com subdomain
        (current.scheduleduptime.com is also provided). This web page is
        available over HTTP at the times indicated. The VM running this site
        shuts down during all other times.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're interested in our content but not able to access it during
        scheduled uptime, here is a simple node.js script that should
        continually determine the next uptime window and retrieve the HTML
        content at the appropriate time, saving the latest version to
        scheduleduptime.html to be read at your leisure:
      </p>

      <pre><code>
import fs from 'fs';
import dns from 'dns';
import http from 'https';

const TEN_MINUTES_MS = 10 * 60 * 1000;

run();

function run() {
  dns.resolveTxt('next.scheduleduptime.com', (err, records) => {
    const [beginIso8601,endIso8601] = records[0][0].split(',');
    const begin = new Date(beginIso8601);
    const now = new Date();

    const msUntil = (begin - now) + TEN_MINUTES_MS;
    console.log(`Next download scheduled in ${msUntil / 1000} seconds`);
    setTimeout(() => {
      retreivePage();
      run();
    }, msUntil);
  });
}

function retreivePage() {
  http.get('https://scheduleduptime.com', (res) => {
    const { statusCode } = res;
    if (statusCode !== 200) {
      res.resume();
      return;
    }

    const file = fs.createWriteStream('scheduleduptime.html');
    res.pipe(file);
  });
}
